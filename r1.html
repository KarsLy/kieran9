            This dish is a <em><strong>filipino variation</strong></em> of the spaniard dish
            <em><strong>ensaïmada.</strong></em>
            The Filipino ensaymada was introduced to the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period, but the
            original Spanish <em><strong>ensaimada de Mallorca dates back to at least the 17th century.</strong></em>
            While the Spanish version was brought to the islands, Filipino bakers later adapted it by adding local
            ingredients, transforming it into its own unique pastry.
